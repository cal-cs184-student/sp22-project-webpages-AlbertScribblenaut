        Points are given into the function <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code> function in the file <code>rasterizer.cpp</code>.
        The function takes in a <code>color</code>value and three points representing a triangle in Cartesian space.
        Determining if a point is inside a triangle is governed by the half-plane equations dictated below:

    <p>
        Correctly rasterizing the triangles requires that all normal vectors of the half-planes face inward.
        In other words, the points fed into the <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> function
        must be given in a counter-clockwise fashion. If the points are given in a clockwise order,
        two of the points were simply swapped using <code>swap()</code> and the half-planes of the triangle were recomputed.
        Points that fall within a triangle are given the same color, and the borders of the polygons are
        filled in with <code>fill_pixel()</code>. The successful implementation of this function is seen in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of speed, the algorithm for <code>rasterize_triangle()</code>
        evaluates points within an axis-aligned bounding box around the triangle of interest.
        To perform this task, the algorithm determines the highest and lowest
        values in Cartesian space and rounds up and down respectively.

    <h1>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h1>
    <p>
        By nomenclature, supersampling is a means for anti-aliasing by increasing
        the sampling rate of the rasterization process. To achieve this, supersampling
        divides pixels into additional subpixels and performs the same triangle test as
        seen in Task 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside <code>rasterizer.cpp</code>, I updated the existing starter code to support supersampling.
        The number of subpixels per pixel was dependent on the sampling rate, therefore pixels were
        divided into a grid <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> by <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code>. For memory management,
        the <code>vector&ltColor&gt</code> <code>sample_buffer</code>, which stores all color samples for pixels in the frame buffer,
        received a pointer such that modification of the vector by way of dereferencing did not take up more storage. Supersampling took place in <code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code>
        and the updated <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> functions. More specifically, the triangle test in <code>rasterize_triangle</code>
        function evaluated subpixels with the inside triangle test from Task 1 and identified the fraction of those that fell within the
        triangle's perimeter. This fraction was then applied to the Red Green Blue (RGB) values stored in the <code>sample_buffer</code>.
        The function <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> translated the <code>Color</code> values stored in <code>sample_buffer</code> to the actual
        RGB values shown on the frame buffer with the <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code> data structure. With pixels having a more
        varied signal as a result of having a fraction of their original RGB values from regular sampling, there is fewer aliasing.

    <h1>Task 3: Transforms</h1>

    <h1>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h1>
    <p>
        Barycentric coordinates establish a coordinate system and geometric center within a triangle, allowing for the interpolation
        of values within the triangle. This offers a simpler expression of positions in the triangle realtive to the triangle 
        itself, as opposed to identifying points within a fixed Cartesian basis of the whole framebuffer, per se. Establishing
        the barycentric coordinates allows for interpolation of values such as colors or textures.
