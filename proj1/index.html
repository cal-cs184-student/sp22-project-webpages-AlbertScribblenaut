			Points are given into the function <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code> function in the file <code>rasterizer.cpp</code>.
			The function takes in a <code>color</code>value and three points representing a triangle in Cartesian space.
			Determining if a point is inside a triangle is governed by the half-plane equations dictated below:

			Correctly rasterizing the triangles requires that all normal vectors of the half-planes face inward.
			In other words, the points fed into the <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> function
			must be given in a counter-clockwise fashion. If the points are given in a clockwise order,
			two of the points were simply swapped using <code>swap()</code> and the half-planes of the triangle were recomputed.
			Points that fall within a triangle are given the same color, and the borders of the polygons are
			filled in with <code>fill_pixel()</code>. The successful implementation of this function is seen in Figure 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of speed, the algorithm for <code>rasterize_triangle()</code>
			evaluates points within a bounding box around the triangle of interest.
			To perform this task, the algorithm determines the highest and lowest
			values in Cartesian space and rounds up and down respectively.
