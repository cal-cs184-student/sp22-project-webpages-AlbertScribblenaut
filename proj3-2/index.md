CS184 Project 3-2: Pathtracer
==============

***Due: April 1, 2022***

**Author:** *Albert Wen*

# Part 1
* Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light.
* Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
* Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear.

# Part 4
For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!

* In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.
* Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene.
* Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture sizes, all focused at the same point in a scene.
